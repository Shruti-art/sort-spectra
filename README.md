Developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for a dynamic user experience.
Users can change the color of the element bars for better visual customization. 
Input array size is adjustable dynamically to suit different sorting scenarios. 
Smooth play/pause functionality for visualizing algorithm steps in real-time.
Control the speed of the algorithm: slow, fast, or ultra-fast for detailed visualization.
Select any sorting algorithm to see how it operates on the array in real-time. 
Algorithm visualizations run smoothly with clear animations of each step.
Interactive design for easy switching between algorithms and visual customization.
